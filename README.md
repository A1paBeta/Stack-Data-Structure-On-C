### Stack Data Structure On C

## 1. Project summary
### 1-1. Contributor
- Yonghyun-Lee(A1paBeta) Hanyang Univ. ERICA 
### 1-2. Project start motive
- Stack data structures were implemented primarily using an array. It was very interesting in the second semester of 2019 when I learned how to implement Single-LinkedList, Double-LinkedList using pointer and dynamic memory allocation in the basic course of system programming. I am going to implement all the data structures I know using Pointer and Dynamic Memory Allocation.
### 1-3. Development environment
I used 'repl.it' cloud development environment

- CPU : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz
- Memory : 2.6 GB 
- Server : Ubuntu 18.04.1 version
- GCC Compiler : 7.4.0 version 
### 1-4. Wanted development function
- Show client menu
- Standard command input
- Typedef stack (data, prevElement, nextElement)
- push
- Show all elements
- Show all elements reverse
- top
- pop
- empty
